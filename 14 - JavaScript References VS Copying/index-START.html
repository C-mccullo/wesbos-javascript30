    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const crew = players;
    console.log(players, crew);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    crew[3] = 'batman';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    //--> players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Batman']
    // when the reference array named crew was updated, it also updated the players array 

    // now here is the problem!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const crew2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    
    const crew3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const crew4 = [...players];
    // OR
    const crew5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    crew4[3] = 'Mr.Freeze';
    console.log(crew4);
    console.log(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
        firstName: 'Bugs',
        lastName: 'Bunny',
        age: 77
    }

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const person2 = person;
    // person.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 1 });
    console.log(person2);

    // Hopefully soon we will hopefully see the object ...spread operator

    // const person4 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const spidey = {
        name: 'peter',
        age: 24,
        social: {
            twitter: '@spiderman',
            facebook: 'peterParker'
        }
    };

    console.log(spidey);

    const hero = Object.assign({}, spidey);
    
    // however, if we --> hero.social.twitter = '@peterParker'
    // console.log(hero);
    //console.log(spidey);
    // Object.assign only clones the object 1 LEVEL DEEP!
    
    //*** not great but ...
    const hero2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(spidey));
